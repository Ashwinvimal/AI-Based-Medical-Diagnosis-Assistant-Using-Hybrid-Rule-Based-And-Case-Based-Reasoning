# AI-Based-Medical-Diagnosis-Assistant-Using-Hybrid-Rule-Based-And-Case-Based-Reasoning
In modern healthcare, accurate and timely diagnosis is essential for improving patient
outcomes and supporting effective clinical decision-making. Traditional diagnostic
approaches often rely heavily on doctor experience and manual symptom interpretation, which
can be time-consuming, inconsistent, and prone to human error. To overcome these
limitations, this project proposes an AI-based hybrid medical diagnosis assistant that
integrates Rule-Based Reasoning (RBR), Case-Based Reasoning (CBR), and Naïve Bayes
probabilistic inference for reliable disease prediction. The system analyzes user-entered
symptoms, applies expert-defined medical rules, retrieves similar historical patient cases, and
computes disease probability scores to handle uncertainty caused by overlapping symptoms.
By combining knowledge-based and data-driven reasoning, the hybrid approach improves
diagnostic accuracy and explainability compared to standalone methods. The proposed model
serves as an effective decision support tool for doctors and healthcare institutions, helping
reduce diagnostic delays, improve early disease detection, and enhance the overall efficiency
and quality of modern healthcare systems. The modular and scalable design allows easy
adaptation to new medical knowledge and future integration with hospital information
systems. Experimental evaluation demonstrates improved performance in terms of accuracy,
reliability, and diagnostic confidence.
